# Exercise: React Bootstrap

In this exercise, you will add the React Bootstrap component library to their applications and learn to leverage pre-styled components.

NOTE: There are multiple ways of leveraging Bootstrap component styles in your React application. The `react-bootstrap` package is one convenient way to get started.

## Instructions

- In your React app's root directory, install the bootstrap and react-bootstrap dependencies using `npm i bootstrap react-bootstrap`.

- To verify this step was successful, check your `package.json` file. Both packages should now be listed inside of `dependencies`.

- Import `bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css` into the `src/index.js` file.

- Try adding a `Navbar` component and at least one other React Bootstrap component to your application following the directions in the documentation.

- Explore working with component props to further customize component behavior and presentation.
