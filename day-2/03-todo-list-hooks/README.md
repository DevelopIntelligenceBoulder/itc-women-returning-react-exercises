# Exercise: To Do List (with Hooks!)

## Instructions

### Setting Up

- Copy the `ToDoList.js`  and `ToDo.js` files into your `src` folder.

- In your `src/App.js` file, import `ToDoList.js` and add the component to App.js's return.

- Verify that the component renders and that you can add, remove, and toggle tasks.

### Refactor to a Functional Component

- Convert `ToDoList.js` to a functional component using hooks. 

- You will need:

    - `useState()` hook

    - `useEffect()` hook
    
    - `useRef()` hook
