# Exercise: Create React App

In this exercise, students will be using the popular create-react-app package to generate a new React application. Once a project has been created, students will explore the starting architecture to gain a better understanding of how React apps are typically constructed.

## Instructions

- Generate a new react project by running `npx create-react-app <appname>`.

- Run `ls` to confirm the the `<appname>` directory has been created.

- `cd` into the `<appname>` folder.

- Run `npm start` to launch the app's development server.

- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to confirm the app is running.

- Open the project folder in VS code and locate `src/App.js`.

- Make a change to the JSX, save it, and see your change reflected in the running app (no refresh needed).
